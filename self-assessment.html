    <p>Throughout my time in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University, and while putting together this ePortfolio, I’ve grown a lot—both technically and professionally. Between the coursework and my internship at Compotech in Orono, Maine, I’ve built the skills I need to move toward a career as a full-stack software engineer.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest areas of growth for me has been learning how to work well with others in a team setting. At Compotech, I’ve collaborated with a group of twelve engineers with varying levels of experience. Through meetings, planning sessions, and code reviews, I’ve learned how to give and receive feedback in ways that help the entire team improve. Working on real projects has helped me understand how to meet client expectations as part of a larger development process.</p>

    <p>I’ve also improved my communication with clients and stakeholders, especially those who aren’t technical. My coursework at Southern New Hampshire University helped prepare me for this aspect of development. Part of my internship has involved translating client needs into practical solutions. That means balancing what’s technically possible with what makes the most sense for users—a concept emphasized in my academic experience and reinforced in the field.</p>

    <p>Another area that became increasingly important to me during this program is security. Early in my studies, I didn’t always consider how vulnerable software could be without proper safeguards. But as I progressed through the curriculum, security was a recurring focus. I now understand the importance of input validation, error handling, and securing sensitive data.</p>

    <p>In my final artifact, I ensured that all user input was properly validated before storing it in the database. I’ve made secure coding a deliberate focus of my work—not just to avoid bugs, but to protect user data and maintain reliability.</p>

    <p>This ePortfolio is a collection of enhancements to one project that demonstrate my growth as a full-stack developer. The original version was a simple Java-based appointment manager with no persistent storage. With each enhancement, I applied what I learned: building a GUI interface, implementing a search algorithm, and finally, integrating SQLite and separating out the database logic into its own class structure. These updates reflect my improved understanding of user design, data structures, algorithmic thinking, and database development.</p>

    <p>Overall, this portfolio showcases how my degree and hands-on experience have shaped my abilities and confidence as a full-stack engineer.</p>
