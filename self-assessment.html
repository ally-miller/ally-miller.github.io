    <p>Throughout my time in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University, and while putting together this ePortfolio, I’ve grown a lot, both technically and professionally. Between the coursework and my internship at Compotech in Orono, Maine, I’ve been able to build the skills I need to move toward a career as a full-stack software engineer.</p>

    <p>One of the biggest areas of growth for me has been learning how to work well with others in a team setting. At Compotech, I’ve been collaborating with a group of twelve engineers who all bring different levels of experience to the group. Through meetings, planning sessions, and code reviews, I’ve learned how to give and receive feedback in a way that helps the whole team improve. Working on real projects together has helped me understand how to meet client expectations as part of a larger development process as well. </p>

    <p>I’ve also gotten better at communicating with clients and stakeholders, especially those who aren’t technical. My course work at Southern New Hampshire University prepared me for this as well. Part of my job has involved taking what the client wants and turning it into something we can create. That means finding the balance between what’s technically possible and what’s going to make sense for the user, which is a concept I learned in my course work and have applied to my internship. It’s been a great experience for me to understand how software development works outside of just writing code.</p>

    <p>Another area that has become important to me throughout this program is security. Early on, I did not always think about how vulnerable software can be if it is not written with security in mind. As I progressed through my course’s security was a concept that came up often, in multiple classes. I now understand just how critical things like input validation and error 

handling is. In my final artifact, I made sure all my input was properly validated before being stored into the database. I have learned throughout my course work that writing secure code is not just about avoiding logic bugs, but also about protecting user data and it is something I have made a real effort to incorporate into my work. 
</p>

    <p>This ePortfolio is a collection of work I have done to show my skills that I have developed throughout this program. It includes three artifact enhancements to one project showcasing my full stack skills. The original project was a simple Java-based appointment manager with limited functionality and no persistent data storage. The program at Southern New Hampshire University has given me a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software design principles and I applied that knowledge when I improved two of my artifacts by creating a graphical user interface and building a searchable interface for user data. I’ve also had the chance to work with databases more and in my final artifact, I redesigned the appointment manager to use SQLite and separated out the database logic into a dedicated class structure. Overall, these artifact enhancements show the growth I’ve accomplished in my degree as well as my abilities as a full stack engineer. </p>
