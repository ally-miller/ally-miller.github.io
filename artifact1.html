      <p>
        This enhancement focused on improving the user experience of my Appointment Management System by transitioning it from a terminal-based application to a fully interactive GUI built using Java Swing. This update reflects skills in software architecture and user interface design. The GUI supports viewing, adding, and managing appointments and represents a significant advancement in usability and functionality compared to the original version.

      <h2>Artifact Narrative</h2>

      <p><strong>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</strong></p>
      <p>The artifact is an appointment management system that I originally created in CS-320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. It was created as part of an assignment to learn the core Java concepts including object-oriented programming, and basic file handling. The original version was a terminal based version that allowed users to add, view, and delete appointments through a text-based interface with substantial testing done for the project overall. The goal of the project was to apply foundational concepts in object oriented programming while emphasizing testing.</p>

      <p><strong>Why did you include this in your ePortfolio? What does it showcase?</strong></p>
      <p>I chose this artifact for my ePortfolio because it offered me an opportunity to show growth in front end by creating a working GUI for this project. I am lacking experience in this area so it was something I  knew I wanted to do as part of an enhancement for this class. To improve this artifact, I transitioned it from a command line interface to a graphical user interface using Java Swing. This change greatly enhances the program as most users would require a graphical user interface over a command line interface for real world applications. This enhancement reflects a more complete and user-focused version of the original tool.</p>

      <p><strong>Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet? Any updates?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, I believe I have met the course outcomes that I targeted in module one. With this enhancement I have shown my ability to use modern tools in computing by applying Java Swing to create a functional GUI. I also met outcome 3 by making intentional design choices such as the layout of the GUI. I don’t have any updates as of now, but maybe in the future adding color and making it look more appealing would be a great option. </p>

      <p><strong>What did you learn during this enhancement? What were the challenges?</strong></p>
      <p>Enhancing this artifact taught me how to apply GUI principles to an existing backend without compromising the existing code. I learned how to work with Java Swing components like Jframe, Jtextfeild, Jbutton, and Jlist and how to handle events to update the interface. One challenge I faced was configuring the project environment in my IDE as I hadn’t touched this project in years. I also ran into issues with understanding how Java Swing handles layout but worked my way through the issues to create a layout I was satisfied with. These challenges improved my debugging skills, and my environment set up skills which I do feel are important to always be improving on. </p>
