    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This enhancement focused on improving the user experience of my Appointment Management System by transitioning it from a terminal-based application to a fully interactive GUI built using Java Swing. This update reflects skills in software architecture and user interface design. The GUI supports viewing, adding, and managing appointments and represents a significant advancement in usability and functionality compared to the original version.
